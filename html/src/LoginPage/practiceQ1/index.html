<h1>The Tech Chronicle</h1>
<p id="paraText">As the world continues to embrace technological advancements at a pace that’s growing exponentially, the demand for software
    developers is on the rise. It is software developers who collaborate with data scientists and analysts to build software and
    applications that are transforming the entire canvas of the global society on a massive scale. Today we have an app for addressing
    all our needs – Uber, Airbnb, Zomato, PayPal, Amazon, and so much more. Then again, we now have smart personal assistants like Siri,
    Alexa, Cortana, and Google Assistant that can perform a range of impressive tasks for us, from controlling our IoT devices to doing
    shopping for us!  </p>
